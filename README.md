# Yogurt Landing Page Practices

This is a **Yogurt Landing Page** project built using **React** and **Vite** for fast development with **TailwindCSS** for styling. The purpose of this project is to practice building responsive landing pages while learning and implementing TailwindCSS efficiently.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Vite**: A fast and modern build tool for React applications with hot module replacement (HMR) for a smooth development experience.
- **TailwindCSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.

## Features

- Responsive design optimized for various screen sizes.
- Minimalistic and modern layout showcasing yogurt products.
- Practice of **TailwindCSS** for utility-based styling.
- Fast development with **Vite** setup.
- Clean and simple structure for easy scalability.
Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript and enable type-aware lint rules. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
